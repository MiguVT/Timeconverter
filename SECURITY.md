# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Timeconverter seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us protect our users by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): https://github.com/MiguVT/Timeconverter/security
2. **Email**: contacto@miguvt.com

### About This Project

Timeconverter is a simple, client-side time conversion tool. Due to its straightforward nature, serious security vulnerabilities are unlikely - but not impossible. Still appreciate any reports to keep things safe for users.

### What to Include

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

This project is primarily maintained by one person ([@MiguVT](https://github.com/MiguVT)), so please be patient:

- I'll do my best to respond as quickly as possible
- I'll work to fix legitimate security issues promptly
- **No guaranteed timeline** - but security issues are treated as high priority
- With your permission, I'll credit you in the security advisory

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We release security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes    |
| Older   | ❌ No     |

We recommend always using the latest version of Timeconverter.

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

When using or deploying Timeconverter:

- Keep your dependencies up to date (pin versions, don't use `latest` - if someone compromises a dependency, they compromise your app)
- Use HTTPS when deploying (not critical for a client-side app with no sensitive data, but still good practice)
- Follow the deployment guidelines in the README
- Report any suspicious behavior

## 📜 Security Update Policy

As a solo-maintained project, I don't have fixed SLAs, but my approach is:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Highest priority - addressed ASAP
- **Other issues**: Fixed as quickly as possible based on severity and availability

## 🙏 Thank You

Thanks to the security research community and anyone who helps keep Timeconverter safe. Your patience and help protecting users is appreciated!
