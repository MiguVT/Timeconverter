# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Timeconverter seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us protect our users by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): https://github.com/MiguVT/Timeconverter/security
2. **Email**: contacto@miguvt.com

### About This Project

Timeconverter is a simple, client-side time conversion tool. Due to its straightforward nature and minimal attack surface, serious security vulnerabilities are unlikely but not impossible. We still appreciate any security reports to ensure the safety of our users.

### What to Include

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

This project is primarily maintained by one person ([@MiguVT](https://github.com/MiguVT)), so please be patient:

- I'll do my best to respond as quickly as possible
- I'll work to fix legitimate security issues promptly
- **No guaranteed timeline** - but security issues are treated as high priority
- With your permission, I'll credit you in the security advisory

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We release security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes    |
| Older   | ❌ No     |

We recommend always using the latest version of Timeconverter.

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

When using Timeconverter:

- Keep your dependencies up to date (PIN your versions, avoid using `latest`, if a user compromises your dependencies, they may compromise your app)
- Use HTTPS when deploying (Not really necessary for a client-side app, they won't have anything sensitive, but still a good practice)
- Follow our deployment guidelines in the README
- Report any suspicious behavior

## 📜 Security Update Policy

As a solo-maintained project, I don't have fixed SLAs, but my approach is:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Highest priority - addressed ASAP
- **Other issues**: Fixed as quickly as possible based on severity and availability

## 🙏 Thank You

I appreciate the security research community and users who help keep Timeconverter safe. Thank you for your patience and for helping protect our users!
