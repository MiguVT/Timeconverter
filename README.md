# 🌍 Timezone Converter

A **simple, fast, and clean** timezone converter. No bloat, no ads, no tracking.

## Why?

I searched for a simple timezone converter tool online. What I found:

- ❌ Complex APIs that require setup (And some simple ones are just APIs, we really don't need an API for this)
- ❌ Websites full of ads and trackers
- ❌ Slow, cluttered interfaces
- ❌ Hidden malware and spam

I built this to prove you don't need any of that. Just a **clean, functional tool** that works.

## ✨ Features

- **🌓 Smart Dark Mode** - System, Light, or Dark theme
- **🔍 70+ Timezones** - All major cities worldwide
- **🌐 Multi-Language Search** - Find timezones in English, Spanish, and more
- **⏰ Auto-Detect** - Instantly detect your current timezone
- **🔄 Swap Timezones** - One-click timezone swapping
- **📱 Fully Responsive** - Works on any device with a web browser, including phones, tablets, desktops, and even unconventional devices (e.g., Nintendo 2DS, though not tested).
- **⚡ Ultra-Fast** - No tracking, no analytics, no bloat
- **🎨 Beautiful UI** - Modern design with smooth animations
