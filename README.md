# 🌍 Timezone Converter

A **simple, fast, and clean** timezone converter. No bloat, no ads, no tracking.

## Why?

I needed a simple timezone converter. Googled it. What I found:

- ❌ Complex APIs that require setup (seriously, we don't need an API for this)
- ❌ Sites plastered with ads and trackers
- ❌ Slow, cluttered interfaces
- ❌ Sketchy downloads with malware

So I built this. No BS, just a **clean tool** that works.

## ✨ Features

- **🌓 Dark Mode** - System, light, or dark theme
- **🔍 70+ Timezones** - All major cities worldwide
- **🌐 Multi-Language Search** - Search in English, Spanish, and more
- **⏰ Auto-Detect** - Finds your timezone automatically
- **🔄 Quick Swap** - One-click timezone swapping
- **📱 Responsive** - Works on phones, tablets, desktops (probably works on a Nintendo 2DS too, haven't tested though)
- **⚡ Fast** - No tracking, no analytics, no bloat
- **🎨 Clean UI** - Modern design with smooth animations
